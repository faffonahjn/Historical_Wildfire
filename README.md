## 🔥 Historical Wildfires Analysis & Prediction

Analyzing wildfire occurrences and predicting wildfire risk using machine learning.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes historical wildfire datasets to identify the factors contributing to wildfire outbreaks and builds a model to predict wildfire occurrence or severity.

This project demonstrates skills in:

EDA on environmental datasets

Working with temporal and geospatial data

Feature engineering

Predictive modeling

Data visualization

Insight generation

## 🛠 Tech Stack

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Folium / Plotly (optional maps)

Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Project Workflow
1. Exploratory Data Analysis

Yearly and seasonal wildfire patterns

Burn area distribution

Correlation between vegetation, temperature, wind, and fire events

Map visualization (if included)

2. Data Preprocessing

Handle missing environmental readings

Encode categorical variables

Create temporal features (month, season, year)

3. Machine Learning

Models tested:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting

KNN / SVM

Optional: XGBoost

Model metrics:

Accuracy

F1-score

Precision/Recall

ROC-AUC

## 🔥 Key Insights (Examples — replace with your findings)

Wildfires peak during the summer months with elevated temperatures.

Wind speed and humidity are strong drivers of fire spread.

Random Forest provided the highest predictive accuracy.

Some regions show consistent year-over-year increases.
